=== Change-over
The changes do not result in migration work, they are backward compatible.

== Warning for uninitialized data

*Changes*

* min and max constant for the years (min: 1) max (2100)
* if the processing concerns a year that does not fall within this range than exception occurs
* the initialization for 3 years (current, before and after the given year) remains at the start of the module, but if it is required during execution and the cache does not yet contain the affected year then initialize it (weekday is workday, weekend is non-working day)
* the years specified in the input file are considered reliable years, if the processing concerns other years then it is no longer reliable
* two new methods have been implemented to decide whether processing only affects reliable (guaranteed) or unreliable years:

=== Change-over
The changes do not result in migration work, they are backward compatible.

== Source folder synchronization

This feature allows you to not have to restart the module after modifying the source data file. The source folder is checked at regular intervals (hourly), and if the contents of the folder have changed, the module will re-initialize itself.

=== Change-over
The changes do not result in migration work, they are backward compatible.

== Java11 upgrade
JDK version upgraded 1.8 to 1.11

=== Change-over
*Workday Calendar can only be used where the JDK version is at least 1.11.*

== Replacing project-specific Exception with Coffee Exception
The project-specific BusinessException has been removed and instead the CalculatorCoreAction methods will throw the Coffee BusinessException if any validation is failed.

=== Change-over
You must already expect the Coffee BusinessException when using the CalculatorCoreAction methods.
